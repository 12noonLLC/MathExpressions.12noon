We are unable to share Properties\Resources.resx in other projects
because the ResXFileCodeGenerator creates the namespace based on
the path, and it includes all of the periods.

namespace MathExpressions.......Shared.Source.MathExpressions.Properties {

So, we have to copy the Resources.resx file to any project that needs it.
